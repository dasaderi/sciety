## Summary

The COVID-19 health emergency is being met with a large response from the academic community. Publications are being released at an ever increasing rate, and due to the emergency nature of COVID, preprint publications which can be published in a single day are becoming very important in the international conversation. However, preprints are not peer reviewed, nor are they validated using established journal quality checklists. 

On the positive side, preprints are under a license permissive to text mining, making it possible to deploy AI-methods, which function as at cursory check on various items that under normal circumstances would likely be caught by editors or reviewers. 

The Automated Screening Working Group has been using our tools to screen COVID-19 preprints posted on bioRxiv and medRxiv.

## How it works

All COVID preprints are screened with Jetfghter, SciScore, ODDPub, LimitationRecognizer, Barzooka, and Seek and Blastn. For more about each tool, please see the main tool page: [https://scicrunch.org/ASWG](https://scicrunch.org/ASWG)

We understand that all rigor criteria are not applicable to all preprints, nor that preprints that passed all automated checks are reproducible, nor do we assert that preprints that do not meet the criteria are necessarily of poor quality. We intend to point out to the scientific community that certain criteria are not met by some preprints and that scientists may consider these key rigor metrics when attempting to review the manuscript and draw conclusions.

We cite sources for each criterion (e.g., sex as it relates to COVID) on this webpage:
