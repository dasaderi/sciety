## Summary

Biophysics Colab is a collaboration of biophysicists who are working in partnership with eLife to improve the way in which original research is evaluated. We aim to drive forward the principles of open science by providing an equitable, inclusive, and transparent environment for peer review. Our ambition is to facilitate a publishing ecosystem in which the significance of research is recognised independently of publication venue.

We will achieve these goals by leveraging our knowledge and expertise to provide considered, appropriate and constructive feedback on publicly available preprints. We will guide researchers to form the best possible interpretation of their data and launch a new journal in which we will endorse rigorous and robust studies in the form of articles. The relevance of these studies to the immediate community, the wider scientific enterprise, and society as a whole will be flagged by an ongoing curation service that recognises how the value of data can increase over time as scientific understanding progresses.

Biophysics Colab is the first endeavour of the fledgling non-profit organisation, Science Colab, whose mission is to add rigour and integrity to the scientific literature in a way that supports and benefits the scientific community.
