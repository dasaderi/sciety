_Rapid Reviews:_ COVID-19 is an open-access overlay journal that seeks to accelerate peer review of COVID-19-related research and prevent the dissemination of false or misleading scientific news. The editorial team identifies papers related to the novel coronavirus and its impacts that have been posted to preprint servers across a wide range of disciplines, including biology, medicine, engineering, economics, and qualitative social sciences and commissions cross-linked, rapid peer reviews of these articles and reports. The journal also offers publishing options to the authors of papers that are positively reviewed, providing a vital outlet for research communications produced in the wake of the pandemic.
